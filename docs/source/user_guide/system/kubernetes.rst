Kubernetes
^^^^^^^^^^

Kubernetes is the core of the whole platform.
You can interact with Kubernetes either via the Kubernetes Dashboard, accessible on the *System* menu in the web interface or directly via the terminal using `kubectl` on the server. 
In case anything on the platform is not working, Kubernetes is the first place to go.
To debug using Kubernetes, refer to :ref:`faq_debug_kubernetes`.
